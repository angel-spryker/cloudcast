# Chapter 4: Race Against Time
## Secret Military Facility, Rome, 14:33

"The onboarding process is completed", claimed Mr. Wr√≥blewski, from the other side of the line. Spryker's Support team had done their part of the job. And now, having the development environments interconnected with Cristina's SDK, and the battle outside raging, the pace in the control room became feverish.

Cristina led the charge, her hands dancing over her keyboard as she deployed in Spryker CI, focusing on what she did best: developing software. Her team, assembled from the best Spryker Partners, followed her lead.

They had to deal with a system that hadn't been used in years. Upgrades were needed at the project level. They felt the weight of time pressing down on them, but the Spryker Upgrader tool helped accelerate the process.

By the afternoon, they were running deployment tests in the staging environment. Everything seemed to be going smoothly until Cristina spotted a bug in the checkout process. Panic threatened to set in, but her calm focus prevailed.

Using APM and logs on New Relic, she traced the exception and repaired the flaw. Another deployment, and the system was functioning well again.

Outside, Rome was chaos. People were fleeing the city, clogging the roads and harbors. The threat was palpable, but inside the facility, humor still found a place. "What do they want? The secret of the pizza?" Cristina joked, her eyes never leaving her screen.

Commander Pagani explained the alien's true goal: a millennia-old relic, the key to terraforming Earth to suit their species, risking all existing life on Earth.

The gravity of the situation fueled their determination. Spryker scaled its infrastructure to the max, enabling a VPN bridge with the surviving military infrastructure.

The machine began recognizing faults, cataloging the pieces to be replaced, and the order was placed with Acme GmbH in Germany. The system monitoring tracked every change.

"It's on, Commander...", whispered Cristina.

The tension in the room was palpable. Time was slipping through their fingers, but everything was running smoothly. Outside, the world might have been falling apart, but inside, they were rebuilding a pipeline of hope.
