# Chapter 2: The Call to Action
## Cristina's Apartment, Rome, 10:06

Cristina's phone vibrated violently, jolting her from her horrified fascination with the news. An incoming call from an unknown number, at a time like this?

With trembling hands, she answered, her voice cracking, "Hello?"

"Cristina, this is Commander Carlo Pagani. We need you at our secret military facility. A ground unit will be there in 15 minutes. Prepare yourself."

She stammered, trying to find words, her mind still reeling from the reality of the invasion. "Me? Why me? What's happening?"

"The answer will be revealed soon. Just know that you and your expertise with Spryker are vital. Hurry."

The line went dead, leaving Cristina frozen, the weight of her destiny pressing down on her like the ancient ruins of her beloved city.

She looked around her apartment, at the computer where she crafted intricate codes, at the pictures of her favorite sculptures, and the lingering aroma of last night's pizza. Everything that defined her life was about to change.

Her heart pounded in her chest as she grabbed her laptop and essentials. The familiar lines of code she used to write now seemed trivial compared to the urgent task thrust upon her.

Minutes later, as promised, the military vehicle arrived, its engine roaring, ready to take her to the secret facility. The soldiers' faces were grim, their eyes reflecting the urgency and uncertainty of the moment.

As the vehicle sped through the chaotic streets of Rome, Cristina's mind raced, trying to comprehend the turn of events. Her skills with Spryker had always been her pride, but she had never anticipated that they would become humanity's last hope.

The car approached the hidden military facility, nestled among the Roman ruins, its modernity a stark contrast to the ancient stones. The doors swung open, and Commander Pagani's stern face greeted her.

"Cristina," he said, urgency in his voice, "we only have one weapon against the aliens, and it's an old spaceship equipped with plasma cannons. But it's been unused for five decades since the War against AI, and it relies on Spryker for self-repair. You're our only hope."

The words sank in, and the weight of the world suddenly rested on Cristina's shoulders. Her knowledge, her expertise with Spryker, was now the key to saving the planet.

And time was running out.
