# Chapter 1: The Sudden Strike
## Rome, 09:32

In a parallel universe, where tales of UFOs and crashed spaceships in the Antarctic had become mundane headlines, the world continued to spin, almost indifferent. People in bustling Rome, from the Colosseum to the modern heart of the city, glanced at the news but dismissed it as a misunderstanding or mere fiction.

Cristina, perhaps the best developer of the technology Spryker, was enjoying her well-deserved vacation. Living in Rome, she loved programming, Neapolitan pizza, and photography. Her peaceful existence, like a code perfectly written, had no room for glitches.

But at exactly 09:32 AM on the 14th of September, everything changed.

The sky over Rome darkened as alien vessels descended upon the city. Laser beams, hot as the sun's core, targeted military data centers, rendering them smoking ruins within seconds. Panic spread through the streets like a computer virus, unchecked and wild.

Citizens stared at the skies, eyes wide with terror, unable to process what they were witnessing. Cars screeched to a halt, and people screamed, their voices drowned out by the unworldly roar of the alien craft.

Inside her home, Cristina's eyes were glued to the live broadcast on her screen, her mind trying to debug this impossible reality.

The city trembled under the alien attack, the ancient and modern entwined in a sudden dance of chaos and fear.

No casualties were reported, but the panic had taken root, not just in Rome but across Europe. The news no longer seemed like fiction. It was cold, hard reality, and it was just the beginning.

The military leaders, understanding the gravity of the situation, convened in a secret facility on the outskirts of Rome, amid the ruins of the Roman Empire.

It was time to call the one person they could trust to resolve the problem: Cristina, the Spryker developer.

And the clock was ticking.
