# Chapter 3: The Impossible Task
## Secret Military Facility, Rome, 10:57 AM

The imposing military spaceship stood tall, a relic from a bygone era, yet still striking in its majesty. Styled like a mechanical colossus, reminiscent of the Evangelion units, it was a fusion of raw power and intricate design. Time had not dulled its aura of menace.

Cristina approached it with awe, her developer's mind already probing its intricacies. Commander Pagani, watching her, knew that only she had the touch to awaken this technological marvel.

"What are we waiting for?" she asked, opening her laptop.

"Go ahead, Cristina. We trust you."

With the Spryker SDK at her fingertips, she initiated a diagnostic run, only to realize something horrifying: the spaceship functioned on Spryker on-premises, and the necessary data centers had been obliterated by the aliens.

The room fell into a stunned silence as she delivered the news. Her words felt like a blow, taking away their last hope.

"The good news," she said, forcing optimism into her voice, "is that we have backups of the codebase and data. The bad news is that it will take me days to rebuild everything from scratch. The infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, permissions... everything."

"No, we don't have days, Cristina. We have hours," Pagani replied, his voice hard. "What do you need?"

"The best Spryker software developers you can find," she answered without hesitation. "And one more thing. We must move our systems to Spryker Cloud. It's the only way to resolve this today."

The military leaders hesitated, concerns about security and resilience on their faces, but Cristina's conviction won them over. She explained Spryker Cloud's unparalleled safety features and its optimizations, tailored explicitly for Spryker's requirements.

With military efficiency, they agreed, and within moments, Spryker Support was contacted, and the onboarding process began.

As the shift and lift of the codebase and data were initiated, the room's atmosphere changed from despair to determination. The clock was still ticking, but now they had a fighting chance.

Outside, the city continued to reel from the attack, but inside the secret facility, amidst the echoes of the Roman Empire, a group of warriors prepared for battle, armed not with swords but with composable code, sohpisticated logic, and unparalleled innovation.

Their enemy was alien, but their spirit was human. And they were not about to give up.
