# 🛸 Cloudcast: the Alien siege
## A story of rapid delivery

In a parallel universe, UFO sightings and crashed ships in Antarctica have become common news. Cristina, Rome's best Spryker technology developer, leads a simple life until September 14th, when aliens attack Rome, targeting military data centers.

Summoned to a secret military facility, Cristina learns about an old spaceship armed with plasma cannons. However, it's reliant on Spryker technology, which is now inaccessible due to the destruction of on-premises data centers.

With no time to build everything from scratch, Cristina persuades the military to move to Spryker Cloud. Working with a team of the best Spryker developers, she initiates an urgent shift and lift of the base code and data.

Despite the chaos in Rome and the constant threat of alien attack, Cristina manages to upgrade the old software and fix a critical bug. The ship's self-repair system starts to function, ordering the necessary parts from a German supplier.

As aliens discover their base and attack, a desperate battle unfolds. Soldiers barely manage to install the new parts before the ship takes off, piloted by Stefano. The ship's cannons destroy the alien forces.

The world celebrates, but the real hero is Cristina. Her expertise and quick decision to use Spryker Cloud saved the day, a testament to the power of technology not just for convenience but as a vital defense and connector of humanity.
